# Clean Install vs Backup

When it comes to setting up a new computer what is your preference? In my case I much prefer to do a clean install it might take a lot longer but I feel like that's the best way to set up a new system from scratch. So any errors or old files which you might have had but forgotten about are no longer an issue. It's also a great way to get rid of any bugs or problems that you might have had as this is going to be a brand new start.

I also find it great setting up a new development environment that matches your needs. However on the other side maybe some people just don't have the time and they just want to restore their computer to how it was before and avoid wasting a few days downloading and installing everything over again.
