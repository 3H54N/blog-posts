If I had asked myself this question a few months ago my answer would have been JavaScript. However since then I have learned more programming languages and I think that Kotlin is extremely versatile. You can do web development, server side scripting, native development for desktop operating systems as well as mobile development for both Android and iOS. It's even capable of doing machine learning too.
