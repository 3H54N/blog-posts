# Day 56 #100DaysOfCode

I just improved a MERN stack app which I have been working on by adding CSS Grid for styling and updating the codebase.

You can see the final version on my GitHub at [Anime Tracker](https://github.com/andrewbaisden/anime-tracker) feel free to clone and download the repo. This version has a `.ejs` frontend.

There is also a video demo of it working on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewbaisden/status/1288161913092874240)
