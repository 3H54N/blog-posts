# What is the most practical server side language to learn in 2020 - 2021?

The only backend server side language I know is Node.js. However I have noticed that on some job search platforms server side languages like Java seem to be the most in demand. And I recently had a recruiter reach out to me about a role but the backend server side languages that they wanted was either Java or Python. Node.js is growing in popularity but it seems like there are still many other server side languages that have more usage within the industry.
