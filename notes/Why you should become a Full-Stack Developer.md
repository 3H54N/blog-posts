There are countless benefits to becoming a Full-Stack Developer. These days many companies tend to hire developers who can work across the whole stack. The more skills you know and the more experience you have the easier it will be to get hired. Gone are the days when you could comfortably sit back and coast through a job knowing a small set of skills. Nowadays you have lots of young aspiring developers who are super ambitious and devoted to absorbing and learning everything they can.

You can't afford to become complacent as the industry moves so fast. Those who embrace change and stay up to date with new trends and technologies remain at the forefront and become the "go to" tech person to follow when it comes to learning. The same is true for people who prefer to stick to old ways of thinking and are afraid to leave their comfort zones.

Of course you can still be successful in the industry if you choose to remain as either a Front-End Developer or a Back-End Developer. But knowing both or at the very least having some exposure to them will not only put you in a higher pay bracket when you are looking for work. But it will also make you more versatile and open up new doors full of opportunities waiting for you to take them. This could be new jobs, connections, freelance work, conference opportunities, collaboration and so much more.

## Future proofing your career path

The famous American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist **Warren Buffett** once said:

> “The more you learn, the more you earn.”

This still remains true even today. I imagine that there are many developers out there who don't really want to add a new technical stack. If you have become really good at creating UI/UX and working on the Front-End then the thought of playing around with a database and server architecture could be seen as boring. And if working on databases, API's and Back-End systems is your thing then you probably would not get a lot of joy out of trying to get websites to look the same across all web browsers and figuring out all of those CSS quirks.

But if you are open minded and want to reach new heights then adding more skills is the way to go. Nobody knows what will happen in the future the tech industry continues to evolve all the time. It is much better to have all of your bases covered so that you are prepared for anything that happens.

## Rapid growth mindset

I was talking to another developer a while back and they were telling me that they don't know any JavaScript frameworks. They have years of experience and they are working as a Senior and yet they have never used a JavaScript framework before. I think this is a good example of why it's important to keep growing as a developer. There are kids who are still in school or just coming out of college who have a more versatile skillset than some Senior developers. And some even have successful products on GumRoad and ProductHunt which are allowing them to generate a passive income stream.

In my opinion if you are an aspiring developer then you should go down the Full-Stack path as quickly as you can. In a few years you will surpass a lot of developers who are older than you. Better yet if age is on your side because you are a young and still in school. Then this is the best time to catch up with your peers and leave them in the dust a few years from now. Those who choose to grow prosper and those who want to go through the motions at the same level begin to stagnate.
