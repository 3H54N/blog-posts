Everybody has a brand it does not matter who you are you have a brand. It is your personal uniqueness that separates you from everyone else. The words that you speak the clothes you wear, your interests everything. Having a personal brand makes it easy for people to recognise you.

Brand recognition is extremely important if you are a business or if you are trying to promote a product. Top brands have brand colours that are immediately recognisable. If you think about companies like Apple, Amazon, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, McDonalds and Coca Cola for example. We have become so accustomed to them you don't even need to look them up you can pull out their brand colour scheme from memory.

## Choosing a brand colour

Associating a colour with yourself and your brand is a fantastic way to become memorable fast. Whenever anyone thinks or sees that colour you will come to mind. The more they see that colour the more they will associate it with you and all the work that you do. It becomes your presence and your theme. At the moment the brand colour that I am using is purple. Funny story I just kept seeing the colour purple everywhere and there were subliminal references too. I took it as a sign and started to use the colour Purple.

I did some research and apparently the colour purple is associated with nobility, luxury, power, ambition, independence, wisdom, devotion, extravagance, pride, and creativity. It resonates with me a lot so it just reinforced me using it. You can see some really good examples for companies and the brand colours that they use on [brandcolors.net](https://brandcolors.net/).
