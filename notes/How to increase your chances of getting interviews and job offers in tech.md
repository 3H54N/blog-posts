Make connections with people who are already working in tech, attend networking events, and join online professional groups to increase your visibility. These connections can help you learn more about the industry, gain insider knowledge on job openings, and get an introduction to potential employers.

Be sure to have at least one technical question prepared to demonstrate your knowledge. Additionally, have a few questions of your own to ask the interviewer. This shows that youâ€™re engaged and have done your research.
