# Quntis Screen Light Bar Vs. BenQ ScreenBar

## What is a Light Bar

A computer display Light Bar is a long horizontal bar with an LED light at the bottom. It is intended to be placed on top of your computer display and shines a light downwards towards your desk. They are compact and portable, taking up little room on your desk because they just sit on top of your computer display.

Various companies use different naming conventions such as "Light Bar", and "Lightbar" with no spacing in between Light and Bar as well as "ScreenBar", and "LED Monitor Light" but they are all essentially the same type of product. In this article, I will simply refer to them as "Light Bar" or "ScreenBar" when referring to the BenQ model. Their whole purpose is to create the perfect lighting environment in dark conditions so that a user is able to see their computer screen and work in the dark without getting eye strain. This is perfect for people who like to either code or do the writing while in a dark room.

In a previous article, I already did a review of the BenQ ScreenBar. This time I was given the opportunity to give the Quntis Screen Light Bar a test run so now is the perfect time to compare the two and see which one comes out on top!

## Price difference

Let's compare the price difference between the two of them. This is how much they are worth on Amazon on the 10th of August 2022.

- Quntis Screen Light Bar: £36/$39.99
- BenQ ScreenBar: £89/$107.91

The Quntis Screen Light Bar wins round 1 because it is the cheaper of the two. But there are far more factors to take into account and usually the more expensive product is higher quality. But if you are looking for value for money then the Quntis Screen Light Bar would be a good option.

- Quntis Screen Light Bar: 15.7 x 0.78 x 0.78 inches
- BenQ ScreenBar: 18 x 4 x 4 inches

The Quntis Screen Light Bar is the smaller of the two when compared next to each other so it wins this round because its more portable and has a smaller footprint.

Unboxing's are always fun let's see whats inside each box.

### Quntis Screen Light Bar box contents

- Quntis Lamp Bar x1
- USB Cable x1
- Screen Clip x1
- Adjustment Cover x2
- Manual x1

### BenQ ScreenBar box contents

- ScreenBar x1
- USB Cable x1

The Quntis Screen Light Bar has Adjustment Covers which is cool but I don't think it makes that much difference if the clip is positioned correctly. So this round is a draw.

### Round 4 Winner

## Clip comparison

This is where things start to become very interesting. In my opinion the BenQ ScreenBar's clip is much better than the Quntis Screen Light Bar's clip. And the price difference really starts to show now because it is just more premium. It is spring loaded whereas the Quntis Screen Light Bar requires manual force to adjust it. The BenQ's clip also feels like it is more balanced too.

Another thing that I noticed is that it's so much easier to attach the BenQ ScreenBar to the clip it comes with. The Quntis Screen Light Bar is a lot harder to assemble and requires more force to put it together and take it apart which is annoying. This round goes to the BenQ ScreenBar.

The Quntis Screen Light Bar clip is at the top and the BenQ ScreenBar clip is at the bottom in this image.

This round is another tie because they are almost exactly the same in this area. I think the BenQ might excel in some areas and it has up to 50,000 hours of lifespan. But in daily usage, you probably won't see much difference between them other than the fact that the BenQ is longer so you will have a bigger light area.

Working in the dark is a great experience when using either one of them because they don't give you eye strain and your screen is extra crisp and easy to see in the dark. I did not notice any reflections or glare when using them so if you want to write or do your coding in the dark you will have a great experience. These light bars are so much better than a desk lamp which was designed for reading books in the dark but not for viewing a computer screen.

You are also going to get used to having them on top of your monitor. For the first few weeks I thought they were an eye sore but now it just feels like its part of the screen my eyes barely notice it. In the dark it becomes invisible so all you have is the light illuminating your desk area.

## Final thoughts

The Quntis Screen Light Bar is most definitely better value for money because it is almost comparable to the BenQ ScreenBar and costs about 1/3 less which is massive if you are trying to make some savings. However the BenQ ScreenBar has better brand recognition because it is more well known and the build quality is just a little bit more premium which is what you would expect because it costs a lot more.

If you want a high quality Light Bar that is arguably the market leader then go for the BenQ ScreenBar. Otherwise if you are on a budget and don't want to invest loads of money on a Light Bar then buy the Quntis Screen Light Bar. It is so close to the BenQ ScreenBar in terms of performance you probably won't even be able to tell the difference and it's much more affordable!
