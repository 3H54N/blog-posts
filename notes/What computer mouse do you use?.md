I am currently using an Apple Magic Mouse 2 and I used to think that it was amazing. However lately I have realised that it might not actually be that comfortable in long term usage. This has become quite apparent recently especially when gaming which requires intense focus. I find that the sides of the mouse tend to feel quite sharp if you hold it too tight. And lets not forget about the Apple Magic Mouse 2's biggest flaw...
