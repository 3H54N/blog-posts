I have been using the QCK Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad. It is like a knife going through butter it is just so soft and smooth. I have the large one at home on my desk and I have a small one that I can use when travelling. It is so much better than just using a mouse on a desk as it can scratch the surface and it is also noisy when you are moving it around.
