When I am not programming I usually play games, watch series/movies/anime or something on YouTube. I also have audio books and podcasts to listen to in my free time as well. Working out and going outside for fresh air is also great when you have been in front of a screen all day. I'm sure a lot of you out there have lots of cool hobbies or families to care for in your downtime.
