# Useful courses for becoming a MERN stack developer

I am a huge fan of Udemy when it comes to learning. They have programming courses for almost anything. I have put together a selection of the courses I have used as well as a few from the popular developer Wes Bos who has his own platform and is not on Udemy. These courses cover Javascript, React, Redux, MERN, TDD/BDD and much more! Even Data Structures and Algorithms is covered so you can get yourself ready for interviews too!

__TDD/BDD__

Use Jest and React Testing Framework/Enzyme for testing frontend code. And use Mocha and Chai for testing backend code.
