# 11 Types of Twitter Users and How They Compare
The Twitter community is amazing there are so many different people on the platform. That's one of its greatest selling points you can connect with like-minded people fairly easily just by following them. However it is not all sunshine and rainbows because you are highly likely to encounter not only positive people but negative ones too. People who use Twitter can be divided into different groups and sorted by type.

This is my own opinion I know that everyone will have a personal thought on this so feel free to share it in the comments if you want to. It would be great to get some feedback on this lighthearted article. Also it is likely that a few of these will have similarities and could be grouped together as it is common for people to fit inside more than one category. These are the 10 types of Twitter users and how they compare with each other.

## Twitter Users

### 1. The Celebrity
Celebrities are some of the most recognizable and popular people on the planet. Almost everyone knows who they are or has at least heard something about them from someone. They are global brands who have between thousands and millions of followers usually. They tend to be people who act, sing, model, play games and sports among other things.

### 2. The Influencer
These type of people are extremely popular and usually have thousands, hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of followers. They tend to be people with a high social status who have grown a strong brand for themselves. Influencer's are content creators and examples of this can be people who blog about tech, fashion, programming, design, etc... I suppose a lot of influencer's could be considered as being a celebrity too if they have a huge following and they are really popular so there is some crossover.

### 3. The Newscaster
Newscaster's have a large following as they are the ones talking about the major news events that occur on a daily basis. It is a source of information that everyone pays attention to. These can be media companies, magazines, celebrities, influencer's, politicians. And other large organizations like TV Networks and people in power.

### 4. The Silent Follower
Silent followers could also be classed as newbies. They are people with low follower counts who either have a low amount of tweets or non at all. This is common for people who have just joined Twitter or still don't understand how to use it properly. Some people even believe that they have nothing of value to say so they just stay silent and only follow accounts for the purpose of keeping up to date with news.

### 5. The Retweeter
Retweeter's are a lot like silent followers but there is a difference. While silent followers say nothing, retweeter's only retweet other peoples tweet and that is how they communicate with people. They very rarely say anything and their personality can be seen from all of the retweets in their timeline.

### 6. The Company
Companies and businesses are a lot like newscaster's. These can be different types of businesses that want to have an active presence on social media. They are the type of companies that do marketing, advertising, provide services, launch products and many other things associated with this genre.

### 7. The Builder
Builders are people who are trying to grow their following and make new friends on Twitter. They can fall into any number of categories as they are trying to find their footing. Networking, meeting new people and gaining exposure is their main goal. Being extremely friendly is a defining trait because they want as many people as possible to like them as they continue to build their brand and reputation. Builders can go on to become influencer's, and newscasters in part due to the fact that they are creating content for others.

### 8. The Personal
A personal account is someone who uses Twitter whenever they feel like it. They might spend a few hours on it or they might use it on a as need basis. Sometimes they have something to say and other times they prefer to keep silent. These type of accounts can vary a lot with some people being really active and others using it sparingly.

### 9. The Troll
There is a popular saying on the internet referred to as "don't feed the trolls". Essentially it means that anytime a troll shows up online you should ignore and not engage with them. Trolls are people who like to grief others with inflammatory conversation that can lead to "flame wars". A flame war is when lots of people engage with the original tweet or comment which turns into a massive argument that goes completely off topic.

### 10. The Bot
Not all bots are bad some provide a really great service like automatically posting good content or retweeting someones tweet to give them more exposure. Although it's not always a good thing when you are only engaging with low value bots and not real people. Bots can also be compared to spammers because they repeatedly do the same thing over and over again. Generating content of which may be of low value to people. Bots can also impersonate people making them fake accounts. In the past this has been used to spread "fake news" and fool people into believing information that is not true.

### 11. The Abandoned
Abandoned Twitter accounts are those that have become inactive as they don't post anymore. It is unfortunate when users choose to leave their Twitter in this state with the last tweet been months or years ago.
