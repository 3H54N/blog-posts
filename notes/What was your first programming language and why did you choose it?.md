# What was your first programming language and why did you choose it?

My first programming language was Visual Basic which may come as a surprise because I never talk about it. That's because back then I was not good at it at all. I don't know if it was the teacher or the language but it just looked completely alien to me. And I think I had this belief back then that you needed to be really good at maths to do programming which is not true. I learned it back in college because it was part of the curriculum but I did not really progress anywhere with it I don't think the class even took it seriously.

We also had a class where we learned the basics of JavaScript which at the time also felt kind of alien to me. I remember the first time I created a simple banner well it was not really my banner I just used view source in the browser to copy the javascript code for an advert for a banner and added that to a simple web page I created. My teacher was totally blown away and did not know how I managed to create it. Which I suppose just goes to show his level of teaching... ðŸ˜…

What was the first programming language you tried to learn and what was your initial experience like? Did you find it easy or hard to learn?
