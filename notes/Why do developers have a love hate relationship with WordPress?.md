# Why do developers have a love hate relationship with WordPress?

Front End Frameworks like React, Vue and Angular have become quite popular for creating websites. Despite this fact WordPress still seems to have a lot of popularity and many companies are consistently looking for developers that know WordPress. However WordPress and PHP go hand in hand and PHP is not as popular as it used to be which is probably one of the main reasons for developers avoiding WordPress jobs.

The JAMSTACK and Headless CMS are still fairly new. Not many developers are familiar with using that technical stack for creating a website with a CMS yet. Whereas it is still very common in the WordPress world and I think that companies are yet to adopt these new ways of building websites. What are your thoughts on WordPress?
