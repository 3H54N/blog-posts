There is so much choice when it comes to buying an external display to use with your computer. I currently have an Apple Thunderbolt Display which is cool however the product has been discontinued. And it only works with older Macs that have a MagSafe connector which limits its usage. MagSafe lacked the versatility and convienience of today's USB-C type connections. It was only a dedicated port for power supply and Apple needed something more useful.

What type of external display do you use with your computer?
