It's actually quite straight forward and I had no idea that it would turn out quite presentable. All you need to do is have a Linkedin profile and then click on the "More..." button and then click the button "Save to PDF". Thats it! I spent ages creating a resume in Word and this Linkedin resume looks almost identical because the content is the same anyway. And as a bonus I was playing around with Linkedin and realised that I could add my GitHub and DEV profile under featured improving my profile even more.

I think I will just use both resumes and see what kind of results I get with my job search.
