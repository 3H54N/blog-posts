# What headphones/earphones do you wear when coding?

I have the Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series I) Wireless Headphones in Silver. They are about 5 years old but still work perfectly unlike those pair of Beats Solo I had a few years back that seem to be built to last a year only before they fall apart ğŸ¤£
