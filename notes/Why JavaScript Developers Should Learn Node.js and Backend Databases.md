## Introduction

For managing data, creating online apps, and powering APIs, Node.js and backend databases are likely well-known to you as a JavaScript developer. But why are Node.js and backend databases so crucial for JavaScript developers to understand? The advantages of studying Node.js and backend databases for JavaScript developers will be covered in this blog article.

## Becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer

There are several benefits to working with Node.js as a full-stack JavaScript developer.

It's not just a fleeting craze since you get to work with a programming language that is becoming more and more popular. Additionally, it implies that you'll have no trouble finding employment in the future if you search for it.

Node.js is one of those languages that may help you be employed by firms who may not have previously considered employing someone with your skill set, thus learning it can increase your career options.

Third, Node.js is a fantastic language for conducting this type of work since it's already well-established as the best tool for developing online apps. If you're interested in dealing with web services or APIs, though.

### Benefits of Learning Node.js

The popular JavaScript runtime environment Node.js is used to create server-side applications. It has a great degree of scalability and may be used to create quick and effective applications. Because Node.js is open source, developers can rapidly pick it up and start deploying apps.

### Benefits of Learning Backend Databases

Data management and storage depend on backend databases. These databases provide more robust capabilities, such as scalability, security, and dependability, than a traditional file system. Additionally, they give programmers strong querying tools and simple access to and management of data.

#### 10 popular databases used by programmers

Here is a list of 10 of the most popular databases used by programmers today. This list is by no means complete as there are dozens of other database options to choose from which is part of the reason why it's so fun to work in tech. There are countless tech stacks and different ways to build an application so you can truly make your own custom build.

1. MySQL: A well-liked relational database management system (RDBMS) that is available as open source and is frequently used in online applications.
2. PostgreSQL: Another open-source RDBMS with a solid reputation for dependability, excellent support for cutting-edge data types, and SQL functionality is PostgreSQL.
3. Oracle: A robust and feature-rich RDBMS that is popular in business settings.
4. Microsoft SQL Server is a well-known RDBMS that the company created. It is utilised in many different applications, including online and mobile ones.
5. MongoDB: A well-liked NoSQL database that excels at both scalability and flexibility.
6. HarperDB: HarperDB is a data management platform that supports SQL and NoSQL. It is completely indexed, avoids data duplication, and may be executed on any device, from the edge to the cloud.
7. Redis: Redis is a message broker or cache that stores in-memory data structures.
8. Supabase: Supabase is a free and open-source alternative to Firebase. With a Postgres database, authentication, quick APIs, and edge functions, you can launch your project.
9. MariaDB: A clone of MySQL, MariaDB is an open-source RDBMS that was created to be completely compatible with MySQL.
10. SQLite: Mobile apps and web browsers frequently employ SQLite, a serverless, standalone RDBMS, for local data storage.

## Conclusion

There are several advantages for JavaScript developers in learning Node.js and backend databases. Backend databases offer strong capabilities for handling data, while Node.js enables developers to swiftly construct and deploy server-side apps. JavaScript developers may advance their programming capabilities by understanding Node.js and backend databases.
