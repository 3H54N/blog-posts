# What type of computer do you use for programming and why?

I use a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014). It is pretty old but it still almost looks like its brand new. Apple really do have good build quality I have never had any problems with it. I have even installed Windows on it using Bootcamp so I can dual boot which is pretty cool.
