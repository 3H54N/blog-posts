## What is programming

Programming is the process of creating instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task. This process involves designing and implementing algorithms, which are sets of step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do. Programming languages are used to write these algorithms and make them understandable to computers.

There are many different programming languages, each with their own unique features and capabilities. Some of the most popular programming languages include JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, and C#. These languages are used in a variety of applications, including web development, mobile app development, and software engineering.

Learning to program can be a rewarding and challenging experience. It can require a strong foundation in mathematical and computational concepts, but not always because for a lot of mundane tasks you can get by with average skills in maths. Also you need the ability to think logically and solve problems, as it involves a lot of trial and error, so you will need to learn how to troubleshoot and debug code.

## How to get into programming

In order to become a programmer, it is recommended to start by learning a programming language and familiarising yourself with its syntax and rules. This can be done through online tutorials, books, or attending a programming course. Once you have a basic understanding of a programming language, you can then start building simple programs and gradually increase the complexity of your projects.

As you become more proficient in programming, you can explore more advanced concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns. This will help you become a more effective programmer and enable you to create more sophisticated and efficient programs.

Overall, programming is a valuable skill that can open up many career opportunities in a wide range of industries. It is a challenging and rewarding field that requires dedication and perseverance, but the rewards can be great for those who are willing to put in the effort.

## Getting a job in tech

You can do a number of things to improve your chances of being recruited as a programmer:

1. Apply for entry-level jobs or internships: Entry-level jobs and internships can be excellent ways to network and pick up useful industry experience. Even while they may not always pay as well as more seasoned professions, these positions can be useful stepping stones for more senior employment.
2. Get a degree in computer science or a related field: While a degree is not always necessary to become a programmer, it can give you a strong foundation in the principles of computer science and help you stand out to potential employers.
3. Continue learning and growing: The field of programming is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up-to-date on new technologies and best practices. Consider taking online courses or earning additional certifications to stay current in your field.
4. Create a portfolio of completed projects: A portfolio of completed projects is an excellent approach to demonstrate your talents and abilities to potential employers. You can grow your portfolio by creating projects on your own or by taking online courses or tutorials.
5. Network and build relationships in the industry: Networking can be a valuable way to learn about job opportunities and make connections in the programming industry. Attend industry events, join online programming communities, and reach out to professionals in the field to build your network.
6. Learn programming languages: You must be proficient in at least one programming language if you want to be a successful programmer. Start learning a popular, in-demand language first, like Python or JavaScript, and then pick up more languages as you need them.
