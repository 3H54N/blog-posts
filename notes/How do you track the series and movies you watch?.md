# How do you track the series and movies you watch?

I have been using [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) you can automatically track what you're watching. Find where to watch TV & movies and discover what's hot. Trakt even works with many services such as Kodi, Plex and Netflix among many others. They even have an API that lets you create your own app [trakt api](https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/#)
