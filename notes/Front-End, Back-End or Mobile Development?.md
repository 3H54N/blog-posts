# Front-End, Back-End or Mobile App Development?

Why do you do what you do what makes it so interesting for you? We live in a world where you have freedom of choice why did you choose to work in your current development environment? I started out as a Front-End Developer and back then the thought of purely working on the Back-End did not appeal to me because I am very visual and I always enjoyed seeing my work come to life in a browser window. 

These days I am more split as my skills are more diverse. But I can imagine that a purely Front-End developer would have no desire to play around with databases. Similarly a Back-End developer would prefer to work on the architecture instead of trying to put together a design using HTML and CSS and having to deal with all of those browser quirks. And then of course there is mobile app development and creating apps.

So what area of development gives you the most passion and if you are a Software Developer or a Full-Stack Developer which area of development gives you the most enjoyment and why?
